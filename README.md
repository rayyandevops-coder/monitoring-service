# Containerized Monitoring Service

## Overview

This project implements a lightweight monitoring-ready microservice using Flask.  
The service exposes health and metrics endpoints and supports failure simulation with automated recovery.

The system is containerized using Docker and deployable on Kubernetes.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate:

- containerized service deployment
- structured logging
- failure detection
- automated recovery
- Kubernetes operational readiness

---

# Architecture

The system consists of:

Flask Monitoring Service  
Background Monitoring Loop  
Failure Detection Logic  
Automated Recovery Mechanism

The monitoring loop continuously checks the service state and triggers recovery when the service becomes unhealthy.

API Endpoints
Health Endpoint

GET /health

Returns the current service health status.

Example response:

{
 "status": "healthy",
 "timestamp": "2026-03-10T12:00:00"
}


If failure is simulated:

{
 "status": "unhealthy"
}

Metrics Endpoint

GET /metrics

Returns service metrics.

Example response:

{
 "requests": 10,
 "uptime_seconds": 200,
 "timestamp": "2026-03-10T12:05:00"
}

Failure Simulation Endpoint

POST /simulate-failure

This endpoint simulates a service failure.

Example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/simulate-failure


Response:

{
 "status": "failure_simulated"
}


Once failure is simulated:

/health returns unhealthy

monitoring loop detects the failure

recovery process is triggered automatically

Failure Detection and Recovery

The system runs a monitoring thread that checks the service state every 5 seconds.

When a failure is detected:

Failure event is logged

Recovery attempt is triggered

Service state is restored

Recovery success is logged

Example log sequence:

failure_simulated
service_unhealthy_detected
recovery_attempt
recovery_successful


All logs are emitted in structured JSON format.

Structured Logging

Each event generates structured logs containing:

event_id

timestamp

log level

event name

failure type

detection time

recovery time

recovery action

source IP

Example log:

{
 "event_id": "1234",
 "timestamp": "2026-03-10T12:00:00",
 "level": "WARN",
 "event": "service_unhealthy_detected",
 "failure_type": "health_check_failed"
}

Running Locally
1 Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monitoring-service.git
cd monitoring-service

2 Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


Dependencies are pinned for deterministic builds.

3 Run Application
python app/app.py


The service runs on:
http://localhost:5000

4 Test Endpoints

Check health:
curl http://localhost:5000/health


Check metrics:
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics


Simulate failure:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/simulate-failure
Docker Build

Build the container image:
docker build -t monitoring-service .


Run container:
docker run -p 5000:5000 monitoring-service


Test service:
curl http://localhost:5000/health

Kubernetes Deployment

Apply deployment:
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml


Apply service:
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml


Check pods:
kubectl get pods


Check services:

kubectl get svc
Kubernetes Self-Healing
The deployment includes:
readiness probe
liveness probe
resource limits

If the service becomes unhealthy:
Kubernetes detects probe failure
container is restarted automatically
This demonstrates basic self-healing behavior.

Reproducibility
The project supports reproducible builds:
pinned dependencies in requirements.txt
Dockerfile builds image from source
Kubernetes manifests included
clear rebuild instructions provided
